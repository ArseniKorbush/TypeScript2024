// Library Structures NEW TOPIC >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

// In general terms, the way the declaration file is structured depends on how the library is used.
// There are many ways to offer a library for consumption in JavaScript, and you will need to write a declaration file to match this.
// This tutorial explains how to identify common library patterns and how to write declaration files that match that pattern.

// Each type of basic library structuring template has a corresponding file in the Templates section.
// You can start with these templates that will help you work faster.

// Definition of Libraries types

// First we'll look at the TypeScript libraries declaration file types. 
// We'll briefly show how each type of library is used, how it's written, and give some real-world examples of libraries.

// Defining the structure of a library is the first step in writing its declaration file.
// We'll give hints on how to identify a structure based on both its usage and its code.
// Depending on the documentation and organization of the library, one may be simpler than the other. We recommend using the one that is more convenient for you.
